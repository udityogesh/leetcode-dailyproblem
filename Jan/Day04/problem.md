# LeetCode 1390 - Four Divisors

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return the sum of divisors of the integers in `nums` that have exactly **four divisors**.

If an integer has exactly four divisors, add the sum of those divisors to the answer.  
Otherwise, ignore the integer.

## Example 1
- 21 has divisors: 1, 3, 7, 21 → exactly 4 divisors → sum = 32
- 4 has divisors: 1, 2, 4 → only 3 divisors
- 7 has divisors: 1, 7 → only 2 divisors

**Output**
32

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10⁴
- 1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10⁵
